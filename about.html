            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.  </p>
